About:
This is my personal brochure website for an upcoming artist. The langue's consist of CSS and HTML. This is a
short and simple website, showing two sections a small bio and a what to look for in the future.
I had made the brochure around my musician name I came up with and incorporated some of my own pictures.
I plan to make this a ecommerce site where it would show the artist merch and buy it there.

BUGS:
The responsive section is a lil glitchy

Plans:
Redo the "about and new release" section
Higher Quality Pictures
Make into a ecommerce site
Add my social links to the icons
